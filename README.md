## Contributing to Marpa::R3

Contributions to Marpa::R3 are welcome.  If you want to work on a new
feature, it is best to ask before investing a lot of time or effort
into it.

This is the repository for Marpa::R3, release 3 of the Marpa Perl
module.

By submitting code to this repository, you are considered to have
signed off on the Developer's Certificate of Origin, which is given
below.

All code contributed must be compatible with the Perl 5.10.1 license,
which is the license covering the Marpa::R3 distribution as a whole.

Copyright assignments are not required (or requested). All code
retains its original ownership.  One implication of this ownership
structure is that any attempt to change the licensing will require
the agreement of all copyright holders.  As a practical matter,
this means that it will soon become impractical to change the
license.

It is imperative that all contributed code be legitimately free
software.  For that reason, code from anonymous (or pseudonymous)
contributors will not be accepted.  By contributing code to this
repository, all contributors "sign off" on that code, agreeing that
the code can be distributed under the Perl 5.10.1 license.  Code which
has not been licensed as free software by its owner, or which risks
creating copyright-related problems (such as code which derives from
reverse-engineering efforts lacking proper safeguards) cannot be
contributed.
