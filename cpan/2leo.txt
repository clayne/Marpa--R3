Throughout, we assume a grammar G, all of whose symbols are accessible and productive.
We assume the parsing algorithm of Leo 1991.

Th: The number of Earley items added by any right recursion for G is less than c,
where c is a constant.

Non-linear RR Lemma: Let RR be a right recursion in G which, for any constant c, adds more
than c items to some Earley set.  Then there is some pair
dr1, dr2 of dotted rules such that dr1 and dr2 share the same transition symbol
and, for any constant c1, dr1 and dr2 appear in
the same Earley set more than c1 times.

Proof: Suppose, for a reductio,
there is some constant c1 such that no pair of dotted rules sharing
a transition symbol appears more than c1 times in RR.
Let the number of dotted rules be |dr|.
Then there will be at most |dr|*c1 Earley sets in which two Earley items share a
transition symbol.
Therefore, there will be a last Earley set in RR in which an Earley items of RR
shares a transition symbol with another item in the Earley set.
This Earley set will have a finite number of items, call it c2.
Subsequent Earley sets will be subject to Leo memoization and have c2+1 items
belonging to RR.
This shows the reductio and the Non-linear RR Lemma.
