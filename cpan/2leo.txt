Throughout, we assume a grammar G, all of whose symbols are accessible and productive.
We assume the parsing algorithm of Leo 1991.

Th: The number of Earley items added by any right recursion for G is less than c,
where c is a constant.

Lemma: Let RR be a right recursion in G which, for any constant c, adds more
than c items to some Earley set.  Then there is some pair
dr1, dr2 of dotted rules such that, for any constant c1, dr1 and dr2 appear in
the same Earley set more than c1 times.
