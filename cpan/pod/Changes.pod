=head1 NAME

Marpa::R3::Changes - Differences between Marpa::R2 and Marpa::R3

=head1 About this document

This document describes the incompatible
differences between Marpa::R2
and Marpa::R3.
(Differences that do not give rise to incompatibility
are outside of its scope.)
It is intended for readers already familiar with Marpa::R2,
who are writing new applications for Marpa::R3,
and for readers migrating Marpa::XS applications
and tools to Marpa::R3.

=head1 Changes

=head2 The Stuifzand interface (PSIF) has been removed

The Stuifzand interface (PSIF), and its documentation,
have been removed.
Important in the development of Marpa,
it now has little or now usage.

=head2 The Thin interface (THIF) is deprecated

The THIF is subject to major change, or outright removal,
without further notice.

=head2 The NAIF is deprecated

The NAIF is an older interface using hashes of named
variables, instead of a DSL.
It is now severely deprecated.
Expect it to be broken or removed shortly.

=head2 LATM is now the default

=head2 [name, values] is now the default action

=head2 Unicode now works in the SLIF DSL

=head2 New method g1_input_span

=head2 Context::location is now Context::g1_range

=head2 New context variable, Context::g1_span

=head2 Marpa::R2::Scanless::G named arguments removed in Marpa::R3

The C<actions>, C<action_object>, C<default_action>
and C<default_empty_action>
named arguments
of Marpa::R2::Scanless::G named arguments
have been
removed in Marpa::R3.

=head2 Marpa::R2::Scanless::G methods removed in Marpa::R3

The
C<Marpa::R2::Scanless::G::g0_rule()> method,
the C<Marpa::R2::Scanless::G::g0_rule_ids()> method,
the C<Marpa::R2::Scanless::G::g1_rule_ids()> method,
and
the C<Marpa::R2::Scanless::G::rule()> method,
discouraged in Marpa::R2,
have been eliminated in Marpa::R3.

=head2 Marpa::R2::Scanless::R methods renamed in Marpa::R3

For historical reasons,
the methods dealing with input and G1 parse location in Marpa::R2
often had unhelpful or misleading names.
In Marpa::R3 an attempt is being made to name
methods dealing with G1 and input parse location consistently,
and to ensure that the
G1 variants
have C<g1> somewhere in their name.
Accordingly,
C<$slr->substring()> has been renamed
C<$slr->g1_literal()>;
and
$slr->current_g1_location() is now $slr->g1_pos().

=head2 Marpa::R2::Scanless::R methods removed in Marpa::R3

The
C<Marpa::R2::Scanless::R::event()> method,
C<Marpa::R2::Scanless::R::last_completed_range()> method,
C<Marpa::R2::Scanless::R::pause_lexeme()> method,
and the
C<Marpa::R2::Scanless::R::range_to_string()> method,
discouraged in Marpa::R2,
have been eliminated in Marpa::R3.
