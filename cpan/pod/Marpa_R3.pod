=head1 Description

=head2 Marpa::R3 is ALPHA and EXPERIMENTAL

Marpa::R3 is in alpha status, and is experimental.
Interfaces will change without notice.
Agressive refactoring is likely,
and this carries the risk of introducing bugs.
Some features will be removed,
and some releases will contain
bugs which are only fixed in subsequent releases
with a different interface.

Please do not use Marpa::R3 for production.

=head2 Overview

Marpa parses any language whose
grammar can be written in BNF.
That includes recursive grammars,
ambiguous grammars, infinitely ambiguous grammars and
grammars with useless or empty productions.
Marpa does both left- and right-recursion in linear time --
in fact if a grammar is in any class currently
in practical use, Marpa will parse it in linear time.

This document centers around a short tutorial
of the Scanless interface (SLIF).
This is the interface most suitable for beginners.
The SLIF is the most suitable interface for most advanced uses as well.

=head1 A simple calculator

The synopsis shows the code for an extremely simple calculator.
It handles only
addition and multiplication of integers.
The sections which follow explain, line by line, how it works.
The explanation will assume that the reader
understands BNF and the basics of grammars -- what rules are,
what symbols are, what the start symbol of a grammar is, etc.

    END_OF_DSL

    my $grammar = Marpa::R3::Scanless::G->new(
        {
            semantics_package => 'My_Actions',
            source            => \$dsl
        }
    );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The code first creates a new SLIF grammar.
SLIF grammars are
L<C<Marpa::R3::Scanless:G>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::G> objects.
They are created
with the
L<Marpa::R3::Scanless:G::new|Marpa::R3::Scanless::G/"Constructor">
constructor.
The arguments to
L<Marpa::R3::Scanless::G::new|Marpa::R3::Scanless::G/"Constructor">
are references to
hashes of named arguments.
In the key/value pairs of these hashes,
the
hash key
is the
name of the argument,
and the
hash value
is the
value of the named argument.

In the example, there are two named arguments to the SLIF grammar constructor:
C<source> and C<semantics_pacakge>.
The value of C<source> must be a reference to a string in the
L<SLIF's domain-specific language|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL>
(DSL).
In this example, the DSL consists of several rules
and pseudo-rules.

The second argument is
a string specifying the "semantics package".
The "C<semantics_package>"
tells Marpa the name of the Perl package that contains
the closures implementing the semantics for this grammar.
We will talk more about this below.

=head2 A G1 rule

Next follows a G1, or structural rule.
The first G1 rule in a script
will usually be the start rule of the
grammar.
(It is also possible to
L<specify the start rule
explicitly|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Start rule">.)

Structural rules are the kinds of rules typically seen in BNF --
they describe the symbols which provide the structure of the grammar,
but leave out details of whitespace.
The SLIF also handles the lexical details in this example.
It does this via L0 rules,
which we will see shortly.

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Calculator ::= Expression action => ::first

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

As is normal for BNF rules, the first rule consists of
a left hand side symbol ("C<Calculator>"),
the BNF operator ("C<::=>")
and a series of right hand side (RHS) symbols.
There is always exactly one left hand side (LHS)
symbol.
There may be any number of RHS symbols.
In the case of an empty rule,
the number of RHS symbols would be zero.
In this rule, there is one RHS
symbol, "C<Expression>".

The BNF operator ("C<::=>") is what makes this rule
a G1 (structural) rule.
Later we will see lexical rules, which will use
the match operator ("C<~>").

After the rule is an adverb:
C<< action => ::first >>.
We'll explain the purpose of the C<action>
adverbs when we discuss
L<semantics|/"Semantics">

The second rule is very similar to the first:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Factor ::= Number action => ::first

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

=head2 More complicated G1 rules

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Term ::=
        Term '*' Factor action => do_multiply
        | Factor action => ::first


=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

This rule says that an C<Term> may be one of two
alternatives:

=over 4

=item *

A C<Term> and a C<Factor> separated by an multiplication operator; or

=item *

a C<Factor>.

=back

Immediately following is another G1 rule defining
a C<Term>.  It is very similar in form
to the one for C<Expression>.

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Expression ::=
        Expression '+' Term action => do_add
        | Term action => ::first

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

=head2 L0 rules

The structural rules define the high-level structure of the grammar,
and ignore details of whitespace, comments, etc.
Now we look at how the low-level, lexical issues are handled.
This very simple calculator language does not allow comments,
but it does define whitespace.

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

          :discard ~ whitespace
          whitespace ~ [\s]+

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The C<:discard> rule is a pseudo-rule, which tells Marpa to use whatever
it matches to separate G1 symbols,
but otherwise to ignore it -- to "discard" it.
C<whitespace> is defined in the next rule as a sequence of one or more spaces.

Note the match operator ("C<~>") in the rule defining whitespace.
It tells Marpa that this rule is lexical and
should be interpreted exactly as written, character
by character.

The C<whitespace> rule is a special kind of rule in two respects.
First, its RHS is followed by a quantifier ("C<+>"), which makes it
a sequence rule.
Aside from the quantifier,
sequence rules may only have a single symbol or character class on their RHS.
The plus quantifier ("C<+>") means a sequence of one or more items.
The star quantifier ("C<*>") is also allowed, and it indicates a sequence of
zero or more items.

The whitespace items are defined by a character class: C<[\s]>.
Marpa supports the same character classes, and the same character class syntax,
as Perl does.

The next pair of L0 rules define the C<Number> symbol

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

          Number ~ digits
          digits ~ [\d]+

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The above two rules say that a C<Number> is a sequence of one or more digits.
C<Number> is a lexeme -- a G1 symbol which is defined and recognized at the lexical
(L0) level.
In this example, there are three other lexemes:
C<whitespace>, and the addition and multiplication operators.

We've already looked at
the C<whitespace> lexeme, which will be discarded without being seen by G1.
The addition and multiplication operators were defined with single quoted strings
in the G1 rules.  As a reminder, here's the rule for C<Term> again:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Expression ::=
        Expression '+' Term action => do_add
        | Term action => ::first

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

In the above rule, the single-quoted string C<'+'> implicitly defines a L0 lexeme.
Something similar happens with the C<'*'> string in the rule for a C<Term>.

Among the acceptable tokens,
Marpa looks for longest matches.
If more than one token is acceptable according
to the grammar,
then the longest match is the winner.

What if the longest match is a tie?
Marpa tolerates ambiguity.
If more than one token tie for longest token,
then all of these ``longest'' tokens are considered in the parse.
The logic of SLIF lexing is described with more precision in the
L<SLIF overview document|Marpa::R3::Scanless>.

=head2 Marpa::R3::Scanless::G::parse

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $input = '42 * 1 + 7';
    my $value_ref = $grammar->parse( \$input );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

To parse a string,
we use
the C<Marpa::R3::Scanless::G::parse()> method.
C<Marpa::R3::Scanless::G::parse()> requires a reference
to a string as its first argument.

=head2 Semantics

The value of the parse result, as returned via the C<parse()> method,
is determined by the parse's B<semantics>.
Marpa's semantics are the traditional ones:
The input is seen as a tree which takes its structure from the G1 rules.
(This is why the G1 rules are called structural.)
The value of the parse results from repeatedly evaluating nodes of this
tree, starting at the bottom, with the results of child nodes made available
to their parent node when the parent node is evaluated.

Parse trees are usually drawn upside-down
with their root at the top,
and their "leaves" at the bottom.
In Marpa::R3's SLIF, the "leaves" are the symbols
that the G1 (structural) rules share with the L0 (lexical)
rules.
The symbols shared by L0 and G1
are those lexemes which are not
discarded.
In this example, the lexemes visible to G1 are
C<Number> and two operators
which are specified
with a quoted string:
"C<+>"
and
"C<*>".

Marpa assigns values to the nodes of the tree,
starting with the leaves.
Marpa's "leaves" will always be L0 symbols,
and their value by default is the literal
value at their location in the input stream.
In the case of the two operators described
by quoted string,
the value is that quoted string.
That is, the value of 'C<+>' is
'C<+>',
and the value of 'C<*>' is
'C<*>'.
The value of C<Number> will be the portion
of the input that matched the C<[\d]+>
pattern.

Starting with the values for leaves,
Marpa::R3 moves recursively
"up" the tree to its root,
assigning a value to each node of the tree
based on the value of its child nodes.
Each non-leaf node corresponds to a G1 rule,
and the children of the non-leaf node
correspond to the RHS symbols
of the rule.
When the non-leaf node is valued, its value becomes
the value of its LHS symbol,
and this value will become
the value of
a RHS symbol of another node with one
exception.

The one exception, the node with a LHS symbol
that does not become a RHS
symbol,
is the value of the top (or "root") node.
The value of the top node becomes the
value of the parse,
and this is the parse result value
to which the C<value()> method
returns a reference.

Each non-leaf node determines its value with an action.
Often actions are Perl functions, which in this context are
called Perl semantic closures.

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $value_ref = $grammar->parse( \$input );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

When we did the parse,
we used the C<semantics_package> named argument.
The value of the C<semantics_package> argument
specifies the package that is used
to find the Perl semantic closures.

By default, a Marpa rule returns
a reference to an array consisting of the rule's name,
followed by the values of its children.
This semantics,
which corresponds to the array descriptor "C<[name,values]>",
is an excellent starting point
when you are first developing a DSL, which is why it is the default.
For more about array descriptors, see the L<semantics
document|Marpa::R3::Semantics/"Array descriptor actions">

In this example,
Marpa's default semantics is not actually used --
we always override it.
In this example,
we specify semantics
by using an
C<action> adverb
for each RHS alternative.
We've seen the C<action> adverb several times,
but skipped over it.
Now it is time to look at it.

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    Term ::=
        Term '*' Factor action => do_multiply
        | Factor action => ::first
    Expression ::=
        Expression '+' Term action => do_add
        | Term action => ::first

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The "C<::first>" action indicates that the value of a rule is to be
the value of its first child,
that is, the value corresponding to the first symbol of the rule's RHS.
(In the case of an empty rule, the value would be a Perl C<undef>).
(The initial double colon indicates a reserved action.)

The action for the first RHS alternative defining C<Expression> is C<do_add>,
and the action for the first RHS alternative defining C<Term> is C<do_multiply>.
To implement these actions, we need to "resolve" their names --
map the action names into
the Perl closures which actually carry out the semantics.

The C<semantics_package> specified the package where we can find the actions:
"C<My_Actions>".
So, to resolve the C<do_multiply> action,
Marpa looks for a closure whose fully qualified name is C<My_Actions::do_multiply>,
which it finds:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    sub My_Actions::do_multiply {
        my ( undef, $values ) = @_;
        my ( $t1, undef, $t2 ) = @{$values};
        return $t1 * $t2;
    }

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The C<do_add> action is resolved
to a Perl semantic closure
in much the same way:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    sub My_Actions::do_add {
        my ( undef, $values ) = @_;
        my ( $t1, undef, $t2 ) = @{$values};
        return $t1 + $t2;
    }

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The Perl semantic closures are callbacks.
They are called as each node in a parse tree is evaluated.

Each Perl semantic closure is called with one or more arguments.
The first argument to a value action is always a per-parse-tree
object, which the callbacks can use as a scratchpad.
In this example, the per-parse-tree object is not used.
The remaining arguments will be the values of the node's "children" --
in other words, the values computed for each of its RHS symbols, in order.
If the action is for an empty rule,
the per-parse-tree object will be its only argument.

Every value action is expected to return a value.
With one exception,
this value is passed up to a parent node
as an argument.
The exception is the value for the start rule.
The return value for the start rule becomes
the parse result.

=head2 Why is it called "Marpa"?

Marpa is the name of the greatest of the Tibetan "translators".
In his time (the 11th century AD) Indian Buddhism was
at its height.
Marpa's generation of scholars was devoted
to producing Tibetan versions of Buddhism's Sanskrit scriptures.
Marpa became the greatest of them,
and today is known as Marpa Lotsawa: "Marpa the Translator".
