=head1 About this document

This document is an overview of B<SLIF parse events>.
SLIF parse events
B<trigger> based on conditions declared in the DSL.
Typical events are the prediction or recognition
of a symbol.

SLIF parse events are often used to allow an application to
switch over to its own custom procedural logic.
Among other things,
an application can do its own "external" scanning of lexemes.
An application may ask Marpa to resume internal scanning at
any point.

=head1 Terminology

=over 4

=item * SLIF parse events are called B<parse events>
or,
in contexts where the meaning is clear,
simply B<events>.

=item * In this document, an B<instance> of a symbol
in a parse
means an occurrence
of the symbol in that parse
with a specific start location and length.
An instance of a symbol is also called
a B<symbol instance>.
A consequence of this definition
is that every symbol instance
has exactly one end location.

=item * For a specific string
and a specific grammar,
we say that a parse is B<valid>
if some parse of the string
exists
according to the grammar.

=item * In a parse,
a B<nulled symbol instance>,
or B<nulled symbol>, is a symbol instance with a length of zero.

=item * A B<non-nulled symbol instance>,
non-nulled instance,
or B<non-nulled symbol>, is a symbol instance which is not
nulled.

=item * A symbol in a grammar is
a B<nullable symbol> if it has
at least one nulled instance
in at least one valid parse of at least one string.

=item * A symbol in a grammar is
a B<nulling symbol> if,
for all strings,
all of its instances in valid parses are nulled instances.
A symbol is B<non-nulling> if it is not nulling.

=item * A string is B<actual to L> if we
know the actual input as far as I<L>,
and the string is consistent with the input.

=item * If we know the input as far as location I<L>
and a symbol I<< <S> >> is in some parse that starts at I<L>,
we say that symbol I<< <S> >> is B<acceptable at
a location L>.
Where location I<L> is understood, we just say
that symbol I<< <S> >> is B<acceptable>.

=item * If a symbol I<< <S> >> ends at I<L>,
and we know the parse as far
as location I<L>,
we say that symbol I<< <S> >>
is B<recognized> at
a location L>.

=back

For those readers who find formal definitions useful,
some of this terminology is defined more
carefully
L<below|"Details">.

=head1 The life cycle of events

=over 4

=item * An SLIF parse event must be B<declared>.

=item * A declared event may B<trigger>.

=back

A parse event is either a B<parse location event>
(aka B<location event>)
or a B<parse instance event>
(aka B<instance event>).
B<Location events>
are those which are deal with the status of the
parse at a particular parse location.
They are declared using named arguments of
the SLIF recognizer constructor.

B<Instance events> are those which report
deal with the status of a symbol instance.
They are declared in the SLIF DSL.

There are two types
of location event:
rejection and exhaustion.
A rejection event is declared using
the grammar's C<rejection> named argument.
A exhaustion event is declared using
the grammar's C<exhaustion> named argument.

An instance event is either
a lexeme event or
a non-lexeme event.
A lexeme event is declared using a
L<C<:lexeme> pseudo-rule|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Lexeme pseudo-rule">.
A non-lexeme event is declared using a
L<named event statement|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Named event statement">.

The various types of parse events are described in detail
L<below|/"Types of parse event">.
The description of
each type of parse event
will state whether it is a location event,
a lexeme event
or a non-lexeme event.

Once declared, a parse event
may trigger during any event-triggering SLIF
recognizer method.
The event-triggering SLIF recognizer methods are
L<the recognizer's C<new()>
constructor|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/Constructor>,
L<C<read()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"read()">,
L<C<resume()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"resume()">,
L<C<lexeme_read()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"lexeme_read()"> and
L<C<lexeme_complete()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"lexeme_complete()">.

The location at which a parse event triggers is the B<trigger location>.
An event may trigger at any location, including location 0.
It is important to keep in mind that location 0 events will
trigger in
L<the recognizer's C<new()>
constructor|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/Constructor>.

In addition to a trigger location,
an event has an B<event location>.
The event location is the same as
the trigger location,
except for pre-lexeme events.
For pre-lexeme events,
the event location is before the
the trigger location.

When an event triggers,
the event handler may B<pause> the recognizer.
If an event pauses the recognizer,
it causes the
event-triggering method
to return as soon as all processing at the
B<event location>
is finished, but before
any processing at later locations.

Some event-triggering methods always return
after processing at each parse location is finished,
and for those methods, it makes no difference
if one of the event handlers
pauses the recognizer.
But,
in the case of the
L<C<read()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"read()"> and
the L<C<resume()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"resume()">
methods,
if an event pauses the recognizer,
the method may return control to the user
earlier than it otherwise would.

Recall that, in the case of
L<pre-lexeme events|/"Pre-lexeme events">,
the event location is before
the trigger location.
This means,
by using a pre-lexeme event to pause
the recognizer,
the app can enforce a form of look-ahead.

The triggering of
parse instance events may be controlled with
the L<activate() method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"activate()">.
An event will only trigger if activated.
By default,
all events are activated when declared.

=head1 Types of parse event

=head2 Completion events

Completion events are declared in the SLIF DSL
using the
L<named event statement|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Named event statement">:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF completed event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event 'a' = completed A
    event 'b'=off = completed B
    event 'c'=on = completed C
    event 'd' = completed D

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

A completion SLIF parse event can be specified for any
symbol that is not a lexeme.
Completion events are non-lexeme events.
A completion event triggers
whenever a non-nulled instance of its symbol
is recognized at the current location.

When a completion event triggers,
its trigger location and its event location
are set to the current location,
which will be the end location
of the instance that triggered the event.
The event is called a "completion"
because, at the trigger location,
the recognition of its symbol
is "complete".

In the SLIF parse event descriptor returned
by the
L<the C<< $slr->events() >>
method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"events()">,
the name of completed event is the only element.

=head2 Discard events

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF discard event statement synopsis 2
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :discard ~ ws event => ws
    ws ~ [\s]+
    :discard ~ [,] event => comma=off
    :discard ~ [;] event => 'semicolon'=on
    :discard ~ [.] event => period

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

Discard events are specified in
L<discard pseudo-rules|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Discard pseudo-rule">.
They are non-lexeme events.
This may seem counter-intuitive,
but a lexeme must be a symbol visible to the G1
grammar and discarded symbols
are discarded
before the G1 grammar can see them.

When a discard event triggers, its trigger location and its event location are set to the current location.
This will be the end location of the discarded text.

In the SLIF parse event descriptor returned
by the
L<the C<< $slr->events() >>
method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"events()">,
there will be 4 elements:

=over 4

=item *

The name of the discard event.

=item *

The start location of the discarded text,
as an offset in the physical input stream.

=item *

The end location of the discarded text,
as an offset in the physical input stream.

=item *

The G1 location of the last lexeme read.

=back

An intended purpose of the G1 location is to allow
the synchronization of data taken from a series of discard events,
with data taken from a parse tree.
Physical input stream locations can often
be used for this purpose,
but an application is allowed to move around
in the physical input stream.
If an application does not move monotonically
through the physical input stream,
physical input stream locations will not
necessarily indicate the order from the point
of view of the parse tree,
and of the virtual input stream.
G1 locations are always in left-to-right order
from the point of view of parse tree,
and of the virtual input stream on which it is based.

Since discarded text is not seen by G1,
it does not really have a G1 location, so the G1 location
reported with the event
is that of the last lexeme read.
All lexemes have G1 locations.
If the discarded text is at the beginning of the parse,
before any lexemes have been read,
the G1 location is reported as zero.

=head2 Nulling events

A nulling event is declared in the SLIF DSL
using the
L<named event statement|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Named event statement">:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF nulled event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event '!a' = nulled A
    event '!b'=off = nulled B
    event '!c'=on = nulled C
    event '!d' = nulled D

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

A nulling SLIF parse event occurs whenever a nulled instance
of its symbol is recognized at the current location.
When a completion event triggers,
its trigger location and its event location
are set to the current location,
which will be
the location where the triggering instance both begins and ends.

A nulling event is a non-lexeme event.
A nulling SLIF parse event can be specifed for any
symbol that is not a lexeme.
A nulled symbol may derive other null symbols,
producing one or more nulled trees;
because a null derivation may be ambiguous,
a nulled symbol may derive more than one nulled
tree.
A set of one or more nulled trees
is called a nulled forest.

When a nulling event triggers for a symbol instance,
all activated nulling events declared
for symbols derived
from the triggered symbol instance will
also trigger.
The triggering of nulling events is recursive,
so that when a nulled symbol instance
triggers an event, it triggers all the events
in the nulled forest derived
from the triggering symbol instance.
Nulled forests are described in more detail
in L<a separate
section|"Nulled forests">.

In the SLIF parse event descriptor returned
by the
L<the C<< $slr->events() >>
method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"events()">,
the name of nulling event is the only element.

=head2 Prediction events

A prediction event is declared in the SLIF DSL
using the
L<named event statement|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Named event statement">:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF predicted event statement synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    event '^a' = predicted A

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

A prediction event triggers whenever
a non-nulling symbol is acceptable at the current location.
When a prediction event triggers,
its trigger location and its event location
are set to the current location.
A prediction may not result in an actual instance of the symbol,
but no actual symbol instance can start
at the event location unless a prediction,
if properly declared and activated,
would trigger at that location.

Prediction SLIF parse events may be defined for any symbol,
whether it is a lexeme or not.
But prediction events are non-lexeme events,
even when their symbol is a lexeme.

In the SLIF parse event descriptor returned
by the
L<the C<< $slr->events() >>
method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"events()">,
the name of prediction event is the only element.

=head2 Post-lexeme events

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF Event synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <a> pause => after event => '"a"'

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

A post-lexeme event is a lexeme event.
It triggers if the lexeme is scanned at the current location.
The SLIF recognizer will have
already read the lexeme
when its post-lexeme event triggers.

When a post-lexeme event triggers,
its trigger location and its event location
are set to the current location,
which will also be the location where the lexeme ends.
A post-lexeme event also sets the
L<C<pause span>|"Pause span">.
Post-lexeme events which trigger during
C<< $slr->lexeme_complete() >> and
C<< $slr->lexeme_read() >> calls are discarded.

In the SLIF parse event descriptor returned
by the
L<the C<< $slr->events() >>
method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"events()">,
the name of post-lexeme event is the only element.

=head2 Pre-lexeme events

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF Event synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <insert d> pause => before event => 'insert d'

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

A pre-lexeme event is a lexeme event.
It triggers if the lexeme is scanned at the current location.
When a pre-lexeme event triggers,
its event location
is set to the current location.
Its trigger location is set to the location where the lexeme starts,
which will be before the event location.
A pre-lexeme event also sets the
L<C<pause span>|"Pause span">.

The SLIF recognizer will B<not> have
read the lexeme
when its pre-lexeme event triggers.
In effect, it "rewinds" the scanning.

For most events, the trigger location is the current location,
but pre-lexeme events are the exception.
Its setting of the trigger location to the start of the lexeme
is consistent with the pre-lexeme event's behavior as a "rewind".
An intended use of pre-lexeme events
is catching a lexeme which
is about to be read, and giving it special treatment.
For more on this, see
L<below|"External scanning">.
Pre-lexeme events which trigger during
C<< $slr->lexeme_complete() >> and
C<< $slr->lexeme_read() >> calls are discarded.

There is a lot of similarity
between pre-lexeme events and predictions,
but there are also very important differences.

=over 4

=item *

A pre-lexeme event does not occur
unless triggering lexeme is actually
found in the input.
On the other hand,
a prediction event is,
as the name suggests, only a prediction --
the triggering lexeme may never
actually be found in the input.

=item *

Even though they have the same
trigger location,
pre-lexeme and prediction events
do not occur at the same time,
because pre-lexeme events
require a scan of the lexeme,
while prediction events do not.
If both
are defined for a symbol,
the prediction event will trigger first,
B<before> the lexeme is scanned.
The pre-lexeme event will trigger next,
B<after> the lexeme is scanned.

=item *

Pre-lexeme events can be defined only
for lexemes.
Prediction events can be defined for any
symbol.

=item *

Prediction events will occur together
with the other events expected at the trigger location.
Pre-lexeme events will not,
because they do not happen at the trigger location --
the trigger location is moved back to the
start of the lexeme as a convenience.

=back

In the SLIF parse event descriptor returned
by the
L<the C<< $slr->events() >>
method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"events()">,
the name of pre-lexeme event is the only element.

=head2 Exhaustion events

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF exhaustion grammar setting synopsis part 1

    my $g = Marpa::R3::Scanless::G->new(
        {
            source     => \($grammar),
            exhaustion => 'event',
            rejection  => 'event',
        }
    );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

=for Marpa::R3::Display

        my @shortest_span = ();

        my %event_handlers1 = (
              'target' => sub {
                   my ($slr) = @_;
                   my $pos = $slr->pos();
                   @shortest_span = $slr->last_completed('target');
                   diag(
                       "Preliminary target at $pos: ",
                       $slr->g1_literal(@shortest_span)
                   ) if $verbose;
                  return 'pause';
              },
              q{'exhausted} => sub {
                  return 'pause';
              }
        );

        my $recce =
          Marpa::R3::Scanless::R->new( { grammar => $g,
              event_handlers => \%event_handlers1,
          }, $recce_debug_args );
        my $pos = $recce->read( \$string, $target_start );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

An exhaustion parse event triggers on asynchronous parse exhaustion,
if the grammar's C<exhaustion> setting is "C<event>".
The name of the event is
"C<'exhausted>"
(The initial single quote is part of the event's name,
and indicates it is a reserved name,
which will not conflict with
the name of any user-named event.)

Intuitively, parse exhaustion events are created only when
needed for control to return to the application.
More precisely,
a parse exhaustion event is called B<synchronous> if it
occurs at a G1 location where control would return to the application
in any case, either due to end of string or another event.
A parse exhaustion event is called B<asynchronous> if it is not
synchronous.

The event itself is often simply discarded,
because an application typically
does not care whether
exhaustion is synchronous or asynchronous.
The L<C<exhausted()> method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"exhausted()">
can be relied on to report
both asynchronous and synchronous parse exhaustion,
and it is usually used instead.
Exhaustion is discussed further in
L<a separate document|Marpa::R3::Exhaustion>.

                diag("You fool! you forget the semi-colon at location $pos!")
                    if $verbose;
                return 'pause'
             }
         },
      }, $recce_debug_args );
    $pos = $recce->read( \$suffixed_string, 0, $original_length );

    READ_LOOP: while (1) {
        $pos       = $recce->pos();
        last READ_LOOP if not $rejection;
        $recce->resume( $original_length, 1 );
        diag("I fixed it for you.  Now you owe me.") if $verbose;
        $rejection = 0;
        $recce->resume( $pos, $original_length - $pos );
    } ## end READ_LOOP: while (1)

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

A rejection event triggers if
all lexemes at a G1 location are rejected,
and the grammar's C<rejection> setting is "C<event>".
The name of the event is
"C<'rejected">
(The initial single quote is part of the event's name,
and indicates it is a reserved name,
which will not conflict with the name
of any user-named event.)

=head2 Lexeme events

SLIF parse events are divided
into lexeme and non-lexeme events,
based on their type.
The lexeme events are the pre-lexeme event
and post-lexeme event.

A lexeme event will trigger at the current location
if all of the following criteria,
applied in order, are true:

=over 4

=item *

It is declared in a
L<C<:lexeme> pseudo-rule|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Lexeme pseudo-rule">.

=item *

Its lexeme has been scanned by the L0 grammar at that location.

=item *

The G1 grammar would accept its lexeme at that location.

=item *

The lexeme is not scanned externally,
that is,
it is not scanned
by a call of the
L<C<< $slr->lexeme_complete() >> method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"lexeme_complete()">
or of the
L<C<< $slr->lexeme_read() >> method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"lexeme_read()">
method.

=item *

The event is activated.
An event is activated by default when it
is declared.
Deactivation and reactivation of events is
done with the SLIF recognizer's
L<activate() method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"activate()">.

=item *

Its lexeme priority is higher than, or equal to,
that of any other lexeme
remaining after the previous criteria
have been applied.

=item *

If it is a post-lexeme event,
none of other remaining events are pre-lexeme events.
(In other words, a pre-lexeme event prevents
post-lexeme events from triggering at the same location.)

=back

Marpa allows ambiguous lexemes and,
even after all the above criteria have been applied,
there may be more than one lexeme event at a G1 location.

=head2 Pause span

When a lexeme event triggers, it will set
the B<pause span> to the start physical input stream location
and length of the triggering lexeme.
The pause span is
originally undefined.
Every call
to the L<C<read()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"read()">
or the L<C<resume()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"resume()">
methods resets
the pause span to undefined.
The pause span may be accessed directly
with the
L<C<< $slr->pause_span() >>
method|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"pause_span()">.

=head1 Non-lexeme events

Prediction, completion and nulling events are non-lexeme events.
The conditions for a non-lexeme event are simpler than those for
a lexeme event, because they do not involve lexical processing.

A non-lexeme event will trigger at the current location
if all of the following are true:

=over 4

=item *

It is declared in a
L<named event statement|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"Named event statement">.

=item *

Its B<triggering condition> is true.  Specifically,

=head1 Techniques

=head2 External scanning

Switching to external scanning is an intended use case
for all events, other than exhaustion events.
In particular,
the behavior of pre-lexeme events
is most intuitive when thought about with
external scanning in mind.

L<The example code for this document|/"An example">
contains an artificially simple example of external
scanning.
The symbol C<< <insert d> >> has a pre-lexeme event
declared:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF Event synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    :lexeme ~ <insert d> pause => before event => 'insert d'

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

When this triggers, the code in the example switches to
external scanning:
It reads a C<< <d> >> symbol externally,
skips over the lexeme actually found
in the physical input,
and resumes internal scanning.

=head2 Markers

It is quite reasonable to create "markers" --
nulling symbols
whose primary (or sole) purpose
is to have nulling events declared for them.
Markers are the only way to declare events that trigger in
the middle of a rule.

=head2 Rules

There are no events explicitly defined in terms of rules,
but every rule event that is wanted can be achieved in
one or more ways.
The most flexible of these, and the best for many purposes,
is to use L<markers|/"Markers">.

Another method is to use the LHS of a rule to track rule
predictions and completions.
This requires that the LHS symbol of the rule be unique to that
rule.

=head1 Implications

This section describes
some implications of the SLIF parse events mechanism
that may be unexpected at first.
These implications are Marpa working as designed and,
I hope the reader will agree,
as is desirable.

=head2 Ambiguity

If a parse is ambiguous, events trigger for
B<all> the possible symbols.
A user thinking in terms of one of the parses,
and unaware of the ambiguity, may find this unexpected.
In L<the example|/"An example">,
events for both the symbols C<< <ambig1> >>
and C<< <ambig2> >>, as well as all their
derived symbols, trigger.

=head2 Tentative events

Marpa's events are left-eidetic but right-blind.
Left of the event location, Marpa's events are 100% accurate.
Right of the event location, they are totally unaware of
what the actual input will be --
there is no "lookahead".
Because events trigger based on input action
only up to the event location,
events are B<tentative>.

Once the parse is complete,
and the actual input to the right of the event
location is taken into account,
it is quite possible that
none of the parse trees
will actually contain the symbol instance
that triggered an event.

In L<the example|/"An example">,
prediction and completion
events are reported for the symbols
C<< <start1> >>,
C<< <start2> >>,
C<< <mid1> >> and
C<< <mid2> >>,
but none of these symbols
winds up in
any of the parse tress.
This is because they are derived from
C<< <ambig1> >> or
C<< <ambig2> >>,
and C<< <ambig1> >> or
C<< <ambig2> >> will never be fully recognized
in any of the parse trees.
The reason that
C<< <ambig1> >> and
C<< <ambig2> >> will not be fully recognized
is that their full recognition requires
that there be a
C<< <z> >> symbol in the input and the
input stream in the example does not contain a
C<< <z> >> symbol.

Exhaustion events are not tentative.
All other SLIF parse events are tentative.

In the example, the predictions
for
C<< <mid1> >> and
C<< <mid2> >> do not match anything in
the final parse tree,
because the locations where
C<< <mid1> >> and
C<< <mid2> >> would be predicted are not reached in
those trees.
For similar reasons, nulling events are tentative.

Lexemes can be ambiguous and
when they are ambiguous
one or more of the lexeme alternatives
may not be used in any final parse tree.
Because of this,
lexeme events are also tentative.

After rejection events,
input can be,
and typically is,
retried at the same G1 location.
This is what happens when the Ruby Slippers technique
is used.
Often, on the second or later attempt, one or
more lexemes are found that are acceptable
to the grammar.
For this reason,
rejection events are tentative.

=head2 Nulled forests

When a symbol is nulled, any symbol which can be null-derived
from it
is also nulled.
In L<the example|/"An example">,
when the
symbol C<< <g> >> is nulled,
derived symbols
C<< <g1> >>,
C<< <g2> >>,
C<< <g3> >>,
C<< <g4> >>
are also nulled.

Note that what was said about
L<ambiguity|"Ambiguity">
applies here.
In the example, the symbols
C<< <g1> >> and
C<< <g2> >> are in one derivation,
while C<< <g3> >> and
C<< <g4> >> are in another,
so that not just a parse tree,
but an entire parse forest
is nulled.
(Pedantically, a nulled tree is a forest
of a single tree.)

More precisely,

=over 4

=item *

If the grammar allows
any derivation of the symbol
I<Y> from I<X> in which I<X> and I<Y> are both
nulled; and

=item *

a nulling SLIF parse event
is declared for I<Y> and activated; and

=item *

a nulled instance of I<X> is encountered
in the parse at location I<L>; then

=item *

a nulling SLIF parse event for I<Y>
will trigger at location I<L>.

=back

=head2 Events and instances

As stated above, only nulling instances generate nulling events,
and only non-nulled symbols generate prediction events
and completion events.
Since lexemes cannot be zero length, this means that,
for a given symbol instance,
nulling events and all other events,
are mutually exclusive.
In other words, if a nulling event occurs for an
instance, no other event will trigger for that instance.

Some cases may seem to violate this rule.
For example
at position 23
in the parse in
L<the code below|/"An example">,
we have four events
of four different types,
all for the symbol C<< <e> >>.
In addition to
a nulling event, there is
a post-lexeme event,
a prediction event
and a completion event:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF Event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1
partial: 1

    Events at position 23: "e" ^e ^f e$ e[]

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The reason for this is that these events are
for three different symbol instances, all of which
share the same trigger location:

=over 4

=item 1

A nulled instance at location 23.

=item 2

A potential non-nulled instance, which may begin
at location 23.

=item 3

A non-nulled instance, which begins at location 22
and ends at location 23.

=back

The prediction of the second instance is, in fact,
fulfilled, as reported at location 25:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF Event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1
partial: 1

    Events at position 25: "e" ^f e$

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The second instance is length 1 and predicted at location
23, but its completion is reported at location 25.
This is because whitespace delayed its start by one position.

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF Event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1
partial: 1

    Events at position 21: ^e ^f d$ e[] mid1$ mid2$

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The third instance is reported as predicted at position 21,
even though it actually begins at position 22.
The delayed start is
because of whitespace.

Prediction and completion events exclude
nulled symbols,
because there is no practical distinction between predicting
a nulled symbol, and actually seeing one.
This means that the prediction and completion of a nulled symbol
would always occur together.
This very special nature of nulled symbols motivates their
treatment as a special case.

=head2 Hidden events

An important aspect of the event mechanism is that
it triggers a return from the event-triggering
method at the trigger location.
It may happen, however, that the method would return
at that location in any case,
and in this circumstance
the triggering
can be said to be B<hidden>.
A event which causes hidden triggering is called
a B<hidden event>.

As one example,
the
L<C<lexeme_complete()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"lexeme_complete()"> and
L<C<lexeme_read()>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"lexeme_read()">
methods return at every lexeme at which a lexeme is read, so
all triggering in those methods is hidden triggering.
In L<the example code in this
document|/"An example">,
the events at this location were all caused by hidden
triggering inside a call to C<< $slr->lexeme_complete() >>:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF Event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1
partial: 1

    Events at position 21: ^e ^f d$ e[] mid1$ mid2$

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

As another example,
the C<< $slr->read() >> and C<< $slr->resume() >> methods
return at end of string,
but events may also trigger at end of string.
The events at this location were caused by hidden
triggering inside C<< $slr->resume() >>
at end of string:

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF Event synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1
partial: 1

    Events at position 29: "h" test$

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The L<example code for this document|/"An example">
is programmed with the possibility of hidden
triggering in mind.
To do this, it is careful to access events after its
calls to the
C<< $slr->lexeme_read() >>
as well as to make an additional pass through the event-accessing loop
after an end of string is encountered.

=head2 Lexeme events and external scanning

During external scanning, lexemes are read using the
L<C<< $slr->lexeme_complete() >>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"lexeme_complete()"> and
L<C<< $slr->lexeme_read() >>|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"lexeme_read()"> methods.
Non-lexeme events may trigger during these methods, as was discussed
in L</"Hidden events">.
However, lexeme events that would occur during the
C<< $slr->lexeme_complete() >> and
C<< $slr->lexeme_read() >> methods are ignored,
and will never trigger.

This behavior may seem non-orthogonal,
but in fact it is the most consistent course of action.
A pre-lexeme event occuring during
a C<< $slr->lexeme_complete() >> and
C<< $slr->lexeme_read() >> method call would reverse its effect,
a behavior which is at best pointless.
A post-lexeme event would be less dangerous,
but it would be completely redundant --
its presence or absence
would tell the application only what
the application already knows from the
return of success or failure by the
C<< $slr->lexeme_complete() >> or
C<< $slr->lexeme_read() >> methods.

                },
            }
        }
    );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

=head2 Handlers which require local and non-local data.

We've already shown handlers which use global data.
We took advantage of the fact that hanlders, like all
Perl functions, are closures.

The next example shows the use of a "factory" for making
handlers.
This is the most powerful and general method of making
data available in a wide variety of scopes
to the handler at event processing time.

The anonymous handler returned
by C<factory()> requires a global, a non-local
and a local variable to do its job.
Call this anonymous handler, I<anon>.
The global C<$A_global> is accessible to I<anon>
at event processing time because I<anon> is a
closure.

The variable C<$B_non_local> is not a global --
it is local to
C<factory()>.
But C<$B_non_local> is non-local to
I<anon>.
Nonetheless,
Because I<anon> is a closure,
C<$B_non_local> is available to I<anon>
at event processing time.

Finally, C<$C_local> is not available
when I<anon> is defined,
but is local in the scope
in which I<anon> is instantiated.
C<$C_local> is passed as an argument
to C<factory()>.

           $result = $A_global if $event_name eq 'A';
           $result = $B_non_local if $event_name eq 'B';
           $result = $local_arg if $event_name eq 'C';

=head2 Per-location event processing, using pause

Multiple events can occur at one parse location.
Call this parse location I<pos>.
Callback handlers easily handle situations where the
events are indifferent to whether they occur together
at I<pos> or not.
But, for many apps, it is very important
to be able to handle all the events occuring
at I<pos> together.

There are two ways to do this.
One is to return C<'pause'> from any of the event
handlers at I<pos>.
The recognizer will return control to the app
once all processing at I<pos> is complete,
and the app can do as it wishes.

=head2 Per-location event processing, using an array

This example also addresses the issue of processing events
when the events which occur at a single location
(call it I<pos>) must be processed as a group.
The events are gathered into an array,
and processed when the recognizer is finished.
This method can be more elegant
than pausing the recognizer,
but this method is also less general.

=head1 Details

This section contains additional explanations, not essential to understanding
the rest of this document.
Often they are formal or mathematical.
While some people find these helpful, others find them distracting,
which is why
they are segregated here.

=head2 Terminology

The following are more formal definitions of terms
previously defined in intuitive terms.

B<Actual input>:
Let C<A> be the actual input to a parse.
Let C<prefix(A, L)> be the prefix of C<A> of length I<L>.
Let C<S> be an arbitrary string in the same alphabet as C<A>.
Let C<prefix(S, L)> be the prefix of C<S> of length I<L>.
If C<prefix(A, L) = prefix(S, L)>,
then we say that
string C<S> is B<consistent with
the actual input up to location L>.
For brevity,
we will often say
that C<S> is B<actual to L>.

B<Acceptable>:
if an instance of symbol I<< <S> >>
that starts at location I<L> is in a valid parse
of some string actual to I<L>,
we say that a symbol I<< <S> >> is B<acceptable> at
a location I<L>.
To say that a symbol
is B<acceptable> at
a location I<L> is to say that it is the symbol of
a symbol instance acceptable at location I<L>.

B<Recognized>:
if an instance of symbol I<< <S> >>
that ends at location I<L> is in a valid parse
of some string actual to I<L>,
we say that the instance of symbol I<S> is B<recognized> at
a location I<L>.
We say that a symbol
is B<recognized> at
a location I<L> if it is the symbol of
a symbol instance recognized at location I<L>.
