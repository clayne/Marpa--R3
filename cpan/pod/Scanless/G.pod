=head1 About this document

This page is the reference for the grammar objects
of Marpa's Scanless interface.

=head1 Constructor

The C<new()> method is the constructor for Scanless grammars.
An example of its use is L<above|/"Synopsis">.
The C<new()> constructor accepts a hash of named arguments.
The following named arguments are allowed:

=head2 bless_package

Specifies the name of a Perl package.
The package is used
for blessing node values into a Perl class,
in conjunction with the
L<C<bless> adverb|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"bless">.
C<bless_package> should not be confused with the
L<SLIF's
C<semantics_package> recognizer setting|Marpa::R3::Scanless::R/"semantics_package">.
The two are not closely related.

=head2 exhaustion

The C<exhaustion> grammar setting
determines what happens when asynchronous parse exhaustion occurs.
Intuitively, "asynchronous" parse exhaustion is parse
exhaustion at a point when control would not normally
return to the application.
For details
see the
L<description of exhaustion parse events|Marpa::R3::Event/"Exhaustion events">.

The value
of the C<exhaustion> grammar setting
must be either "C<fatal>"
or "C<event>".
"C<fatal>" is the default.
If the value is "C<fatal>",
asynchronous parse exhaustion is treated as an error,
and an exception is thrown.
If the value is "C<event>",
an event occurs
as described in the
L<section on exhaustion parse events|Marpa::R3::Event/"Exhaustion events">.

=head2 rejection

The C<rejection> grammar setting
determines what happens when all tokens are rejected by the
G1 parser.
The value must be either "C<fatal>"
or "C<event>".
"C<fatal>" is the default.

If the value is "C<fatal>",
rejection of all tokens is treated as an error,
and an exception is thrown.
If the value is "C<event>",
an event occurs
as described in the
L<section on rejection parse events|Marpa::R3::Event/"Rejection events">.

=head2 source

The value of the C<source> named argument must be a reference
to a string which contains a description of the grammar.
The string's format is a domain-specific language,
described L<in its own
document|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL>.

=head2 trace_file_handle

The value is a file handle.
Trace output and warning messages
go to the trace file handle.
By default the trace file handle is C<STDERR>.

=head1 Mutators

=head2 parse()

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: Landing page synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1
partial: 1

    my $grammar   = Marpa::R3::Scanless::G->new( { source => \$dsl } );
    my $input     = '42 * 1 + 7';
    my $value_ref = $grammar->parse( \$input );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

This very-high level method is a "one shot"
way of producing a parse value from a grammar and an input stream.
The features this method provides
are those most often wanted in
the "first cut" of a parser.

As the parser grows,
users are likely to find their application has
outgrown this method.
It is recommended, rather than spend a lot of time
exploring ways to adapt this method to expanding needs,
that users be quick to abandon it
in favor of the lower level calls.
As an example of how to make this transition,
the tutorial in L<Marpa::R3> is reimplemented
using low-level calls in L<Marpa::R3::Tutorial2>.

The C<parse()> method takes one or more arguments.
The first argument, which is required, is a ref to an input string.
The remaining arguments
must be references to hashes of named arguments.
These hash references will be
passed, as is,
to the constructor for the recognizer.

This method returns a reference to the only parse value, if there is
exactly one parse value.
If there is no parse, or if the parse is ambiguous,
C<parse()> throws an exception.

=head2 set()

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLIF grammar set() synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $grammar->set( { trace_file_handle => $trace_fh } );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

This method allows the named arguments to be changed after an SLIF
grammar is created.
Currently, the only argument that may be changed in L<C<trace_file_handle>|/"trace_file_handle">.

=head1 Accessors

=head2 rule_expand()

=for Marpa::R3::Display

    $text .= "Rule #$rule_id: $lhs_id ::= " . (join q{ }, @rhs_ids) . "\n";

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

"Expands" a G1 grammar
rule ID into symbol ID's.
The first and only argument,
which is required, is the ID of the rule to be "expanded".
An array of symbol ID's is returned.
The ID of the LHS symbol is the first element,
and the remaining elements are the ID's of the RHS symbols,
in order.
Returns an empty array if the G1 grammar rule does not exist.

=head2 l0_rule_expand()

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLG l0_rule_expand() synopsis

    my ($lhs_id, @rhs_ids) = $grammar->l0_rule_expand($rule_id);

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

"Expands" a L0 grammar
rule ID into symbol ID's.
The first and only argument,
which is required, is the ID of the rule to be "expanded".
An array of symbol ID's is returned.
The ID of the LHS symbol is the first element,
and the remaining elements are the ID's of the RHS symbols,
in order.
Returns an empty array if the L0 grammar rule does not exist.

=head2 rule_ids()

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLG rule_ids() synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

name: $grammar->rule_name() example

    push @rule_names, $grammar->rule_name($_) for $grammar->rule_ids();

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

Given a rule ID, returns the rule name.
A rule name is as defined by
L<the C<name> adverb|Marpa::R3::Scanless::DSL/"name">.
If no rule name was defined, the rule name is the name of
the LHS symbol.

=head2 rule_show()

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLG rule_show() synopsis

    my $rule_description = $grammar->rule_show($rule_id);

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The first argument, which is required,
is the ID of a G1 grammar rule.
Returns a string describing that rule in a form which is useful for tracing and debugging,
but subject to change.
Returns a Perl undef if the rule does not exist.

=head2 SLG l0_rule_show()

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLG l0_rule_show() synopsis

    my $rule_description = $grammar->l0_rule_show($rule_id);

name: $grammar->start_symbol_id() example

    my $start_id = $grammar->start_symbol_id();

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

Returns the ID of the start symbol.
Note that there is no method to return the ID of the start
rule, because there may be no unique start rule.

=head2 symbol_display_form()

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The first, required, argument is a G1 grammar symbol ID.
Returns the "display form" of the symbol.
This is the symbol in a form thought most suitable for display in messages, etc.
Returns a Perl C<undef> if the symbol does not exist.

The display form of a symbol is always defined.
The display form of a symbol is not useable as a name -- it is not necessarily unique,
and is subject to change.

=head2 l0_symbol_display_form()

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLG l0_symbol_display_form() synopsis

    my $display_form = $grammar->l0_symbol_display_form( $symbol_id );

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLG symbol_dsl_form() synopsis

    my $dsl_form = $grammar->symbol_dsl_form($symbol_id)
        // '[No name in DSL form]';
    $text .= "symbol number: $symbol_id  DSL form: $dsl_form\n";

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

Takes one, required, argument: a symbol ID in the G1 grammar.
The return value is the "DSL form" of the symbol.
This is the symbol exactly as it was
specified by the user in the SLIF DSL.
The return value is a Perl C<undef> if the symbol does not exist,
or if it has no DSL form.

=head2 l0_symbol_dsl_form()

    $text .= "symbol number: $symbol_id  name: $name\n";

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The first and only argument, which is required, is a G1 grammar
symbol ID.
The return value is the name of the symbol, if the symbol exists,
and a Perl C<undef> if the symbol does not exist.

For every symbol ID, this method's return value will be defined
and will be unique to that symbol ID,
so that it is suitable for use as a symbol name.
If the SLIF DSL explicitly specifies a name,
the return value is that explicitly specified name.
Otherwise, the return value is an internal name,
which is subject to change in future versions of Marpa::R3.

=head2 l0_symbol_name()

=for Marpa::R3::Display
name: SLG l0_symbol_name() synopsis

    my $name = $grammar->l0_symbol_name( $symbol_id );

=for Marpa::R3::Display::End

The first and only argument, which is required, is an L0 grammar
symbol ID.
The return value is the name of the symbol, if the symbol exists,
and a Perl C<undef> if the symbol does not exist.

For every symbol ID, this method's return value will be defined
and will be unique to that symbol ID,
so that it is suitable for use as a symbol name.
If the SLIF DSL explicitly specifies a name,
the return value is that explicitly specified name.
Otherwise, the return value is an internal name,
which is subject to change in future versions of Marpa::R3.
